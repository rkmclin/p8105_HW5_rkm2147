# Problem 1

Importing data

``` r
homicide_df = read_csv(file = "./homicide-data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

**Raw data explanation**

The raw homicide data frame contains the variables: uid, reported\_date,
victim\_last, victim\_first, victim\_race, victim\_age, victim\_sex,
city, state, lat, lon, disposition. There are a total of 52179 contained
within. Upon first glance it appears that we will need to tidy the
variable concerning the reported data of the incident that occurred.
Data collected for this frame was by The Washington Post, it gathered
information on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities

Create city\_state variable & resolved variable

``` r
tidy_homicide_df = 
homicide_df %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    ))
```

``` r
homicide_summary_df = 
  tidy_homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Prop test for Baltimore, MD

``` r
prop.test(
  homicide_summary_df %>% 
    filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved) 
  
 , homicide_summary_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample… two.sided

Running a prop test for each city in the data frame

``` r
results_df = 
  homicide_summary_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

    ## Warning in prop.test(x = .x, n = .y): Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect

A plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

# Problem 2

Start with a dataframe containing all file names; the list.files
function will help

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("data")
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("data/", path),
    data = map(path, ~read_csv(.x))
    )  
```

Tidy the result; manipulate file names to include control arm and
subject ID, make sure weekly observations are “tidy”, and do any other
tidying that’s necessary

``` r
tidy_df =
path_df %>% 
 mutate(
path = str_replace(path, "data/con", "control"),
path = str_replace(path, "data/exp", "experiment"),
path = str_replace(path, ".csv", "")
) %>% 
   unnest(data) %>% 
   separate(
   path, into = c("treatment","id")
 ) %>% 
  pivot_longer( 
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "value"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    treatment = as.factor(treatment),
    id = as.factor(id),
    week = as.factor(week)
  )
```

make a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time,
and comment on differences between groups.

need to figure out how to compare control vs treatment

``` r
tidy_df %>% 
 
  ggplot(aes( x = week, y = value, group = id, color = id)) + geom_line() +  facet_grid(rows = vars(treatment)) 
```

# problem 3

x∼Normal\[μ,σ\]

For each dataset, save μ̂ and the p-value arising from a test of H:μ=0
using α=0.05 . Hint: to obtain the estimate and p-value, use broom::tidy
to clean the output of t.test.

``` r
sim_ms = function(n = 30, mu = 0, sigma = 5) {
  
  sim_data = tibble(
    x = rnorm(n = n, mean = mu, sd = sigma),
  )
  
  sim_data %>% 
    summarize(
      mu = mean(x),
      sigma = sd(x)
    )
}
```

Run for μ=0

``` r
zero_output = 
  rerun(5000, sim_ms(30, 0, 5)) %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

Re running for μ={1,2,3,4,5,6}

``` r
mu_list = 
  list(
    "mu_1"  = 1, 
    "mu_2" = 2, 
    "mu_3" = 3,  
    "mu_4" = 4, 
    "mu_5" = 5,
    "mu_6" = 6
    )

six_output = vector("list", length = 6)

for (i in 1:6) {
  six_output[[i]] = rerun(5000, sim_ms(mu = mu_list[[i]])) %>% bind_rows()
}
```
